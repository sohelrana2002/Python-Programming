# You can loop through the set items by using a for loop:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

for x in thisset:
  print(x)


# important you can't loop like that
# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}

# for i in range(len(thisset)):
#   print(thistuple[i])

# important you can't loop like that
# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# i = 0

# while i < len(thisset):
#     print(thisset[i])
#     i = i + 1
