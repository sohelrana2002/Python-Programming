# Dictionary
# Dictionaries are used to store data values in key:value pairs.

# A dictionary is a collection which is ordered*, changeable and do not allow duplicates.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict)

# Dictionary items are presented in key:value pairs, and can be referred to by using the key name.
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964
}
print(thisdict["brand"]) # Ford

# Dictionary Length
# To determine how many items a dictionary has, use the len() function:
thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "model": "Mustang",
  "year": 1964,
  "year": 2020
}
print(len(thisdict)) # 3

# Dictionary Items - Data Types
# The values in dictionary items can be of any data type:

thisdict = {
  "brand": "Ford",
  "electric": False,
  "year": 1964,
  "colors": ["red", "white", "blue"]
}
print(thisdict)

# The dict() Constructor
# It is also possible to use the dict() constructor to make a dictionary.
thisdict = dict(name = "John", age = 36, country = "Norway")

print(thisdict)
